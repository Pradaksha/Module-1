# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, write a program to find distance covered by the car to the given time(hr) and speed(km/hr)

## AIM
To write a Python program to find the distance covered by a car given the time (in hours) and speed (in km/hr).

## ALGORITHM
Start the program.
Prompt the user to input the speed of the car (in km/hr).
Prompt the user to input the time traveled (in hours).
Calculate the distance using the formula:
Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Print the calculated distance.
End the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223020020
# Name-Pradaksha V
time=float(input())
speed=float(input())
dist=time*speed
print("Distance covered is {:.2f}km".format(dist))
```
