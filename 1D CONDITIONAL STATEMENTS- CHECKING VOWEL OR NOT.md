## Experiment No: 1d – Conditional Statements- Write a Python program to check whether the person has fever using simple if statement. Assume the temperature is more than 97 Fahrenheit then the person has fever. 

## AIM  
To write a Python program to check whether a person has fever using a simple if statement, assuming a temperature greater than 97°F indicates fever.

## ALGORITHM  

1.Start the program.

2.Prompt the user to input the body temperature in Fahrenheit.

3.Use a simple if statement to check if the temperature is greater than 97°F.

4.If true, print "The person has a fever."

5.If false, do nothing (or simply end the program).

6.End the program.

## PROGRAM

```python
# Reg.No-212223020020
# Name-Pradaksha V
temperature = int(input())
if temperature > 97:
       print("The person has fever")
else:
     print(" ")
       
```
