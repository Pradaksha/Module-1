## Experiment No: 1d – Conditional Statements- Write a Python program to check whether the person has fever using simple if statement. Assume the temperature is more than 97 Fahrenheit then the person has fever. 

## AIM  
To write a Python program to check whether a person has fever using a simple if statement, assuming a temperature greater than 97°F indicates fever.

## ALGORITHM  
Start the program.
Prompt the user to input the body temperature in Fahrenheit.
Use a simple if statement to check if the temperature is greater than 97°F.
If true, print "The person has a fever."
If false, do nothing (or simply end the program).
End the program.
## PROGRAM
